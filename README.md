# Federal Responsible AI Template

This template is based on the Defense Innovation Unit's (DIU) Responsible AI Guidelines, which can be found [here](https://www.diu.mil/responsible-ai-guidelines).

Open the environment-tracking/setup.txt file and follow the instructions to add automated environment report creation to your project.

The notebooks can be used to set up a pipeline to programmatically set up Experiments, register a model, set up custom metrics, and track and export your models.

1-model-development.ipynb walks you through training an anomaly detection model, setting up a Domino Experiment, and adding the model to the Registry.

Note, you should remove the above section in your newly created project README file.
